<img width="auto" height="300px" align="left" src="./doc/art_niche_main_logo.webp" />


Explore exclusive art collectibles by the most in-demand creators, trade with other collectors in the Marketplace, and mint your own NFTs all in one place!

**ArtNiche** try to eliminate some of the hurdles usually met by content creators who desire to monetize their art by serving it directly to the public. Not only is owning an NFT a trend nowadays, but it has also become a status symbol for those who get into it. In any case, it is an actual investment that has become profitable for both collectors and buyers.

Also you can read more detail information about this project [in this Medium article](https://sanchezsanchezsergio418.medium.com/artniche-revolutionizing-the-world-of-digital-art-with-nfts-and-cutting-edge-architecture-a6cc50d0e8a6).

## What are NFT Art Collectibles?

NFT stands for non-fungible token, a digital asset the ownership of which is recorded on a tamper-proof blockchain that cannot be forged. NFTs represent real-world objects and properties. Compared to cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies, each NFT is unique and cannot be exchanged for another or used to purchase items.

Art Collectibles NFTs may be memorable artworks,  the properties of which are be specified through smart contract rules that govern NFTs.

Factors like digital scarcity and unchangeable ownership generally affect the value of NFTs in ArtNiche. There is so much online content that people usually do not consider these virtual commodities to have real monetary value, so the rarer the digital item and the more it has historical and cultural relevance, the more valuable it will be.

While Art Collectible NFTs may be copied or downloaded, only the creators own it and may sell it. **Ownership may not be manipulated**, since NFTs live on the blockchain where records are immutable, and purchasers may always directly verify a product’s authenticity before a sale.

An ArtNiche creator or seller can search for an art collectible NFTs as well as they also can mint new NFTs, which is essentially uploading the file to be transformed into an NFT and details pertaining to it. Minting is the online process where the files of the item or collectible is recorded on the blockchain.

ArtNiche provide you some free funds of MATIC cryptocurrency and a digital wallet in order to operate with NFT in the marketplace. You could also get more matic from Mumbai faucet from your artist profile.

## How ArtNiche works?

NFTs at ArtNiche are created in two clearly differentiated steps. The image file and the metadata linked to the NFT are formatted and registered in IPFS through the services of the Pinata platform. Once the metadata registration is completed, ArtNiche uses the CID (Content Identifier) to complete the Mint process in the ArtNiche DAPP deployed in a Polygon (Mumbai) tesnet through the wrappers of the smart contracts generated with the Web3J CLI.

Once this process is completed, the user will be informed of the success of the registration, he will be the original owner and creator of that NFT. As the original creator you will have the possibility to define a "royalty" to obtain benefits in future sales.

ArtNiche uses firestore to store complementary information to the NFTs and the use made of them.
